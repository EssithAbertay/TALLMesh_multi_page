# TALLMesh: Thematic Analysis with Large Language Models

TALLMesh is an experimental tool that leverages AI assistance to conduct qualitative analysis on text-based data, specifically emulating stages from the Braun & Clarke approach to inductive thematic analysis. 

It uses streamlit for the GUI elements, and for the analysis it uses code and ideas from these two papers:

## Introduction

TALLMesh is designed to assist researchers, academics, and qualitative data analysts in performing thematic analysis using large language models. The tool follows the six-phase approach to Thematic Analysis by Braun & Clarke, adapted for use with LLMs and their capabilities.

This project is based on research conducted by Prof. Stefano De Paoli and Dr. Daniel Rough, with initial support from the British Academy for designing the Graphical User Interface.

## Features

- Project-based organization for managing multiple analyses
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure)
- Streamlined workflow emulating phases 2, 3, and 4 of Braun & Clarke's six-phase approach:
  1. Familiarization with data
  2. Initial coding
  3. Searching for themes
  4. Reviewing themes
  5. Defining and naming themes
  6. Producing the report
- Interactive visualizations including icicle charts and thematic network maps
- Calculation of Initial Thematic Saturation (ITS) metric
- Flexible prompt engineering for each analysis phase
- Export options for codes, themes, and visualizations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/flipflop4/TALLMesh_multi_page.git 
   cd tallmesh_multi_page
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:

   ```
   streamlit run Thematic_Analysis_LLMs.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to:
   - Set up a new project
   - Upload and manage your data files
   - Configure API keys for LLM providers
   - Perform each phase of the thematic analysis
   - Generate visualizations and reports
