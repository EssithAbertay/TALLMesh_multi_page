11_ðŸŒ³_Nested_Treemap.py

This module creates a nested treemap visualization for qualitative data analysis projects.
It allows users to explore themes, reduced codes, initial codes, and quotes in a hierarchical structure.

The treemap provides an interactive way to visualize the relationships between different levels of coding
in a qualitative analysis project, from broad themes down to specific quotes.

Dependencies:
- streamlit: For creating the web application interface
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- plotly.express: For creating the interactive treemap visualization
- project_utils: Custom module for project-related utility functions
- os: For file and directory operations
- api_key_management: Custom module for managing API keys
