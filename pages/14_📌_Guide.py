TALLMesh Guide Module

This module provides a comprehensive guide for using the TALLMesh (Thematic Analysis with Large Language Models) application.
It includes detailed explanations of each step in the thematic analysis process, from project setup to visualization of results.

The guide is presented using Streamlit's interactive features, allowing users to explore different sections of the application
and understand how to effectively use each component.

    This application is designed to assist researchers and students in conducting thematic analysis 
    using large language models (LLMs). Our approach is inspired by the widely-used Braun and Clarke 
    method, adapted for the capabilities of modern AI.

    TALLMesh aims to streamline the process of qualitative data analysis, offering a novel way to 
    interact with your research data. While it leverages the power of LLMs, it's important to note 
    that this tool is meant to augment, not replace, the researcher's critical thinking and interpretive skills.

    :blue[Key features of TALLMesh include:]
    - Automated initial coding
    - Assistance in reducing and refining codes
    - Support in identifying and defining themes
    - Integration with popular LLM providers

    As you use this tool, remember that the AI is a collaborator in your research process. Always 
    critically evaluate the outputs and use your expertise to guide the analysis.
