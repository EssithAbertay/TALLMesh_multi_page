Azure Settings Management Module

This module provides functionality for managing Azure API settings and deployments
within a Streamlit application. It allows users to input and save their Azure API credentials,
manage Azure deployments, and view current settings.

The module includes functions for loading and saving Azure settings, managing deployments,
and creating a user interface for interacting with these settings.

Dependencies:
- streamlit: For creating the web application interface
- json: For reading and writing Azure settings to a JSON file
- os: For file path operations
