File Upload and Conversion Module

This module provides functionality for uploading various file types and converting them to .txt format
with appropriate encoding. It supports PDF, DOCX, RTF, and other text formats.

The main features include:
1. File upload through Streamlit interface
2. Automatic file format detection and conversion
3. Encoding detection for text files
4. Project-based file management

Dependencies:
- streamlit: for creating the web interface
- PyMuPDF (fitz): for handling PDF files
- python-docx: for handling DOCX files
- striprtf: for handling RTF files
- chardet: for detecting file encodings
